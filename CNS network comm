Here’s a simple list of commands you can run on Command Prompt (CMD) for your Computer Network practical on
“Familiarization of network environment and using network utilities” like ipconfig, netstat, ping, arp, telnet, ftp, finger, and tracert.

🖥️ 1. View Network Configuration
Command:

ipconfig
Use: Displays your computer’s IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

For detailed info:

ipconfig /all
🌐 2. Check Active Network Connections
Command:

netstat
Use: Shows all active network connections and listening ports.

To display continuous updates:

netstat -a
📡 3. Test Connectivity to Another Device or Website
Command:

ping www.google.com
Use: Checks if a host or website is reachable and measures response time.

To ping a specific IP:

ping 8.8.8.8
🧾 4. View and Manage ARP Cache
Command:

arp -a
Use: Displays IP and MAC address mapping in your network.

🔌 5. Connect to a Remote Host Using Telnet
Command:

telnet www.google.com 80
Use: Tests connectivity to a specific port on a remote host.
(Note: You may need to enable Telnet first using “Turn Windows features on or off.”)

📁 6. Connect to an FTP Server
Command:

ftp ftp.dlptest.com
Use: Connects to an FTP server for file transfer.

Then login using:

Username: dlpuser
Password: rNrKYTX9g7z3RgJRmxWuGHbeu
👤 7. Get Information About a Network User (if enabled)
Command:

finger username@hostname
Use: Displays information about a user on a remote system (used in older systems, may not work on modern Windows).

🧭 8. Trace Route to a Website
Command:

tracert www.google.com
Use: Shows the path (routers/hops) data takes to reach a destination.

✅ Optional: Check Internet Connection Status
Command:

ping 127.0.0.1
Use: Tests your own network adapter.

Would you like me to make a step-by-step practical report format (aim, theory, commands, output, conclusion) for this experiment too?

Computer Network Experiment:
“Familiarization of network environment and using network utilities (ipconfig, netstat, ping, arp, telnet, ftp, finger, tracert)”

🧪 Experiment No.: 1
Title:
Familiarization of network environment and using network utilities — ipconfig, netstat, ping, arp, telnet, ftp, finger, tracert.

Aim:
To understand and use basic network commands to check and analyze the network environment and connectivity.

Apparatus/Software Required:
Computer system

Windows Operating System

Command Prompt (CMD)

Internet connection

Theory:
Network utilities are tools used to test, configure, and troubleshoot network connections.
Some common utilities are:

Utility	Description
ipconfig	Displays IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of the system.
netstat	Shows current network connections and listening ports.
ping	Checks connectivity between local and remote systems.
arp	Displays IP and MAC address mapping.
telnet	Connects to a remote system using a specific port.
ftp	Transfers files between local and remote computers.
finger	Provides information about users on a network (if supported).
tracert	Traces the route packets take to reach a destination.
Commands and Their Use:
Sr. No.	Command	Purpose / Output
1	ipconfig	Shows IP configuration of the system.
2	ipconfig /all	Displays detailed network information including DNS and MAC.
3	netstat	Displays all active network connections.
4	netstat -a	Shows all connections and listening ports.
5	ping www.google.com	Tests connectivity to Google’s server.
6	ping 8.8.8.8	Checks connectivity using Google’s DNS IP.
7	arp -a	Shows IP to MAC address mapping table.
8	telnet www.google.com 80	Connects to Google server via port 80 (HTTP).
9	ftp ftp.dlptest.com	Connects to an FTP server for file transfer.
10	finger username@hostname	Displays information about a remote user (if supported).
11	tracert www.google.com	Displays the route data packets take to reach Google.
